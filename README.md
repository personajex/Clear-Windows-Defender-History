# Clear-Windows-Defender-History
This program is capable of deleting Windows Defender threat detection history and Controlled Folder Access Protection history, without having to restart your computer, effectively.
It uses the support of the IObitUnlocker program in its latest version, so the credit is not mine, the IObitUnlocker website is:

I am not responsible for the use given to the program and any damage it may cause.
