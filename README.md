# Clear-Microsoft-Defender-History
This program is capable of deleting Microsoft Defender threat detection history and Controlled Folder Access Protection history, without having to restart your computer, effectively for 32-bit and 64-bit.
It uses the support of the IObitUnlocker program in its latest version, so the credit is not mine, the IObitUnlocker website is:

I am not responsible for the use given to the program and any damage it may cause.
